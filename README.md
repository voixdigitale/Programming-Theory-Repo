# Programming-Theory-Repo
Submission 2 for Jr Programmer Pathway

This project shows the four pillars of object-oriented programming:

**Abstraction**: The drag and drop methods can CastRay() to find the drop position.  
**Encapsulation**: Oxygen and CO2 rates contain a method to make sure that production is positive and absorption negative  
**Inheritance**: PottedPlant, Bush and Tree inherit properties from the Plant class  
**Polymorphism**: Each Plant needs to "ProduceOxygen" with an abstract method
